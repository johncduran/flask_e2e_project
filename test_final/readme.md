# Final Fitness Tracking Website


## Intro

For this final I create a fitness tracking website that allows a user to keep track of various variables that they might be interested in such as their weight, blood pressure, workout routine and more. In this I will have it display the data using a table to keep track of the data in one place for the user using a dedicated endpoint.

I used a variety of technologies in order to create this service. In terms of coding I used python, html and css. The python libraries used were Flask, SQLAlchemy, gunicorn and python-dotenv.These can all be found in the requirements.txt file which was necessary inorder to launch the app. In terms of cloud technolgies I used Google Shell Editor, Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). I used Google Shell Editor for all of the coding involved in this project. Azure was used to support and run the flask app by using App Services. GCP was used to run and support the MySQL database to store the user's responses.
